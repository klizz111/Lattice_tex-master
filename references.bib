  abstract = {In this chapter we describe some of the recent progress in lattice-based cryptography. Lattice-based cryptographic constructions hold a great promise for post-quantum cryptography, as they enjoy very strong security proofs based on worst-case hardness, relatively efficient implementations, as well as great simplicity. In addition, lattice-based cryptography is believed to be secure against quantum computers. Our focus here will be mainly on the practical aspects of lattice-based cryptography and less on the methods used to establish their security. For other surveys on the topic of lattice-based cryptography, see, e.g., [36, 52, 60, 71] and the lecture notes [51, 67]. The survey by Nguyen and Stern [60] also describes some applications of lattices in cryptanalysis, an important topic that we do not discuss here. Another useful resource is the book by Micciancio and Goldwasser [49], which also contains a wealth of information on the computational complexity aspects of lattice problems.},

We obtain several consequences of this algorithm for related problems on lattices and codes, including  an improvement for polynomial time approximations to the shortest vector problem. In this improvement we gain a factor of log log n in the exponent of the approximating factor.},

    abstract = { Abstract We present new faster algorithms for the exact solution of the shortest vector problem in arbitrary lattices. Our main result shows that the shortest vector in any n-dimensional lattice can be found in time 23.199n (and space 21.325n), or in space 21.095n (and still time 2O(n)). This improves the best previously known algorithm by Ajtai, Kumar and Sivakumar [Proceedings of STOC 2001] which was shown by Nguyen and Vidick [J. Math. Crypto. 2(2):181–207] to run in time 25.9n and space 22.95n. We also present a practical variant of our algorithm which provably uses an amount of space proportional to τn, the “kissing” constant in dimension n. No upper bound on the running time of our second algorithm is currently known, but experimentally the algorithm seems to perform fairly well in practice, with running time 20.52n, and space complexity 20.2n. }
